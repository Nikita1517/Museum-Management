        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
           The Museum Management System was born out of the need to modernize and streamline museum operations. Traditional paper-based record-keeping is not only time-consuming but also prone to data loss. Visitors often struggle to find relevant information about artifacts, and staff data management can be disorganized. This system aims to solve these challenges and provide a comprehensive solution.
